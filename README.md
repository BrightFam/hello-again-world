Hi, I'm Rupert. I use the definition of my name, 'BrightFame', as my alias.
The brand that I want to build up and grow with, goes by the name 'BrightFameLabs'.

I am a qualified Civil Technician and have been working as a Civil Contractor for the last 15 years.

I am currently making a huge career change in studying data analysis and learning programming. My interest and passion is to produce music, so the whole change I'm making at the moment, it to connect with my passions and to do what I love.

My vision and goal for the near future  is to start a Data Consulting Firm in Namibia. An opportunity that I foresee in Namibia. 
BrightFameLabs Data Consulting Engineers. That's the vision!

For now, the journey has begun. Lot of work and learning to be done, fortunately, Brightfame is willing and able!
